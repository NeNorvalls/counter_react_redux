## Desired Outcome

A functional "Counter" app with buttons to increment and decrement the count.

## Steps to Achieve the Goals

## Setup Redux

Create a Redux store.

## Define Actions

Create action types (constants) for increment and decrement.
Write action creators for each action type.
Create Reducer:

Write a reducer function to handle state changes based on actions.
Set up the initial state.
Integrate with React:

Connect the Redux store to your React app using react-redux.
Dispatch actions from your React components.
Render Count:

Display the current count in your React component.
UI Controls:

Add buttons for incrementing and decrementing the count.
Dispatch corresponding actions on button clicks.
